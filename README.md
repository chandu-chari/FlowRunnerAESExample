# Flow Runner - PLL Example

This repo is my example for running a flow on the OpenROAD cloud platform. In order to try out this example on their cloud platform, follow the steps:

1. Go to [https://flow.theopenroadproject.org](https://flow.theopenroadproject.org). After logging in (or creating an account for the first time), click on the _My Designs_ tab on the left. Then, click `Import Design`.
2. Enter the URL of my repository and then click `Import`.
3. Run the flow by clicking on `Run on latest version`.

### Want to run your own design?
See their template repo [https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/openroad-template-design](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/openroad-template-design) and follow the steps in its README.
